🚀 Deploy a Serverless Architecture in Cloud <br>
📌 Project Overview <br>
This project explores the integration of serverless computing in cloud environments, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize application deployment and management. The research investigates the key purposes, benefits, and challenges associated with serverless architecture in the cloud. <br>
Through practical case studies and theoretical analysis, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how serverless architecture can enhance scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of management in cloud-based applications. <br>

🔥 Features <br>
✔️ Scalability – Automatically scales applications based on demand. <br>
✔️ Cost-Efficiency – Uses a pay-as-you-go model to optimize resource usage. <br>
✔️ Ease of Management – Offloads operational tasks like provisioning and scaling. <br>
✔️ High Availability – Ensures reliability and redundancy in cloud applications. <br>
✔️ Microservices Integration – Supports modern software architecture principles. <br>
✔️ Global Deployment – Allows function deployment across multiple cloud regions. <br>

⚙️ Methodology <br>
The project follows a Terraform-based deployment strategy using LocalStack as a local cloud environment for testing:

1. Install Terraform – An open-source IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tool. <br>
2. Install Docker – Run LocalStack within a Docker container. <br>
3. Write Terraform Code – Define serverless architecture for local cloud testing. <br>
4. Initialize Terraform – Run terraform init to set up the working directory. <br>
5. Apply Terraform Configuration – Use terraform apply to provision infrastructure. <br>
6. Analyze Output – Evaluate the generated infrastructure graph and serverless setup. <br>
